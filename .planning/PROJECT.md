# SMEAI

## What This Is

A Thai-primary knowledge hub and consulting lead generator for SME owners who want to adopt AI affordably. The site publishes articles, video content, and interactive tools that teach business owners how to use AI to minimize costs — while showcasing real projects Ohm has built (chatbots, clinic dashboards, agent workflows). Visitors either learn to do it themselves or contact Ohm for consulting/services.

## Core Value

SME owners can discover practical, cost-effective AI solutions they can actually use — and reach Ohm when they need help implementing them.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Landing page that communicates what SMEAI offers
- [ ] Blog/article system for Thai-language tutorials and guides (e.g. "How to use Claude Code efficiently", "Setting up a chatbot cheaply")
- [ ] Project showcase with mixed formats (case studies, live demos, portfolio cards)
- [ ] Video content integration (YouTube embeds with companion articles)
- [ ] Interactive tools section (cost calculators, ROI estimators, comparison tools)
- [ ] Contact information display (email, LINE, phone)
- [ ] Link to existing portfolio website
- [ ] SEO-optimized for Thai SME + AI keywords
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design

### Out of Scope

- User accounts / authentication — content is public, no login needed
- E-commerce / payment processing — consulting is handled offline
- Multi-language (bilingual) — Thai-primary for now, English later
- Booking/calendar system — keep contact simple with displayed links
- Comment system — avoid moderation overhead for v1

## Context

- Ohm is a veterinarian turned AI practitioner who builds AI solutions for SMEs and clinics
- Existing projects include: MeowMed (cat health platform), chatbots, clinic dashboards, agent workflows with Claude Code
- Target audience is Thai SME owners — mix of technical (can follow tutorials) and non-technical (need consulting)
- The site serves dual purpose: knowledge sharing (builds trust and community) and lead generation (consulting/services)
- Content will cover real tools and workflows Ohm uses: Claude Code, agent skills, chatbot setups, dashboard building
- Existing portfolio website will be linked from SMEAI
- Thai-language primary, targeting Thai business landscape

## Constraints

- **Language**: Thai-primary content and UI
- **Content**: Must be easy to publish new articles/guides regularly (low friction CMS or markdown-based)
- **Cost**: Site itself should be cost-effective to host and maintain (practice what you preach)
- **Simplicity**: No complex backend — static or JAMstack preferred

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Thai-primary language | Target audience is Thai SME owners | — Pending |
| No user accounts | Content is public, reduces complexity | — Pending |
| Simple contact links over forms/booking | Minimize friction, match Thai business culture (LINE) | — Pending |
| Mixed showcase formats | Different projects suit different presentation styles | — Pending |
