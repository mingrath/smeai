## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 30 requirements (comprehensive depth). Video and Showcase can execute in parallel after Content System.
- [Research]: Astro 5.x + Preact + Tailwind v4 + Cloudflare Pages stack confirmed. Thai-first, mobile-first, content-first approach.
- [Phase 1]: Tailwind v4 is CSS-first (no config file). Use @tailwindcss/vite, not @astrojs/tailwind. Fontsource variable fonts. CF Analytics auto-injects for Pages projects.
- [01-01]: Biome v2.4 schema differs significantly from v2.0 -- uses css.parser.tailwindDirectives, assist.actions.source for organizeImports
- [01-01]: Manual project scaffold needed when .planning/ exists (create-astro rejects non-empty dirs)
- [01-01]: Biome file includes scoped to src/** plus root configs to avoid linting generated .astro/ types
